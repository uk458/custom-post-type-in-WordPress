# custom-post-type-in-WordPress
This code will create a new custom post type called "Custom Posts" with a slug of "custom-posts". You can customize the labels and settings to fit your specific needs. Once the code is added to your functions.php file, you can create and manage custom posts in the WordPress admin area just like regular posts.
